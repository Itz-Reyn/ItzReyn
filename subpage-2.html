                    <h4>currency means the medium of expense. And the word ‘Crypto’ came from a Greek word ‘Kruptos’ which means hidden or secret.
                    Crypto currency is a global currency which can be used anywhere in the world. <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first idea of crypto currency came in 1980.
                     There was a group named “Cypherpunks” which had the influence behind this crypto growth. <br>
                     Cypherpunks are those who were giving the ideas of social and political changes using cryptography. The group of people were blaming the socio-economics system for the descrimination between rich and poor people around the world. <br> So they wanted such a system  where the control the economics won’t be obsessed with just a few people. From this motive , the idea of crypto currency had come. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we talk about local paper based currency, they all are controlled by the government and the central bank of a country. Also this currency varies  from country to country. You can’t use USD on a European country or Rupees on a Middle East country. <br>
                    Speaking about crypto currency , there is no such control board or organization to negotiate the value of it and never will. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Why is crypto currency so safe and accepting worldwide?
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     Well, we can assume that through an example. When we want to transfer currencies from one country to another, we need to pay a transaction fee for that. After paying the fees, the central banks of those countries will exchange the transaction between them. Then the central bank will transfer the money to the local bank and finally the money will be received by the receiver. 
                     <br>
                     But in crypto currency, this whole lot of process can be one within a second. Sender or receiver don’t need any bank or country involvance to send their desired money. All they need is the wallet address of each other.
                     <br>
                     Crypto transactions are only bound with sender and receiver. So in that sense, crypto transactions are more secure than the regular one. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Who provides this security?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Actually it is the miners who provide this security.For that miners get a reward in their crypto wallet as well. <br>
                    The fact of analyzing cryptocurrency is called mining. Mining is a process to judge the transactions. For mining, a lot of difficult mathematical problems need to be solved and process the output in an exact number. This output is called “Hash”.
                    <br>
                    To generate this hash, a lot of computing resources are needed. It is the graphics processing units, which are being used to generate this hash power. 
                    <br>
                    There is also ASICS to mine crypto currency. Those who do this mining process are called “Miners”.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    How crypto currencies work?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This virtual flow of crypto currency works through Blockchain Technology. 
                    <br>
                    Blockchain is data storing technology. It is an open source technology. In this tech, the information is being stored in blocks where the blocks are connected to each other like a chain. The transactions data’s are permanantly stored in the blocks and no one can erase the data. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    According to a state of 2018, there are almost 1600 different types of crypto currencies available on the market. But the first crypto currency was Bitcoin. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    ----BITCOIN------
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                       Bitcoin is the first virtual currency. Bitcoin.org was registered on 18 August, 2008. In that same year, a white paper was published titled “ Bitcoin:A peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System” . the publisher of that paper was Satoshi Nagamoto. That paper was an introduction of bitcoin as well as a description about how it works. From then, is renowned as the inventor of bitcoin.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      On 3 january,2009 the first open source project of bitcoin “Bitcoin Core 0.1” was released. The first transaction of bitcoin was between Satoshi Nagamoto and Hal Finney. 
                      <br>
                      Speaking about  early supporters of bitcoin, Wei Dai and Nick Szabo are the two most common faces.
                    <br>
                    On today’s date, Gavin Anderson is the lead developer of bitcoin.
                    <br>
                    An interesting fact about bitcoin is the maximum number of bitcoin will be 21 million units. Where almost 18.5 million of btc units have been mined already. But the specs say, to mine the last bitcoin, it will take almost 100 more years. 
                    <br>
                    The minimal unit of bitcoin is called Satoshi where 100 million Satoshi is equal to 1 bitcoin.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Which countries accept crypto currency?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The major example is definitely Canada. In Canada they even have specialized ATM booths on the street only for crypto currency transactions.
                    <br>
                    China is also a big fish in this regard. Even a few years back, the chinese government did not allow crypto currency. But now it is like a 360 turn from them. Now they are trying to cover their whole country with this Blockchain tech. They even got their own crypto currency “NEO”. 
                    <br>
                    Denmark is such a country which has accepted Bitcoin such a long time ago. Now they are going for the other crypto currencies as well. 
                    <br>
                    Netherland is trying to convert their whole currency into virtual currency. The Netherlands government has started to accept various cryptocurrencies. 
                    <br>
                    The Russian government has made crypto mining legal in 2018. They are  also accepting crypto’s in this process.
                    <br>
                    When we are talking about crypto currencies, South Korea is such a heaven for this. South Korea deals almost 30% of the whole world’s crypto currency trading. The Korean government is so congenial about crypto currency trading that they are planning to abolish paper based currency and convert them into crypto currencies.  
                    <br>
                    Switzerland is also a crypto friendly country. Even their local governments are using this currency as their regular transaction medium. 
                    <br>
                    Japan is the first country to accept bitcoin as their legal trading method. In Japan one can even buy their grocery items using their crypto wallet. 
                    <br>
                    These countries I mentioned are just a few in this list. It can be predicted that within the next 10-15 years, the whole world will get covered with this virtual crypto currency trading system.
