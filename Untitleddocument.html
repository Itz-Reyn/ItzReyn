    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Covid-19 has hampered the world economy drastically. The income rate of general people has reduced a lot. Many people became jobless. The flow of business has slumped. As a result, economic growth, industries, health, education, service, these all sectors have dealt with some heavy challenges. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The economic aspects of a country depend on income policy, resource structure, family structure, mass people&#39;s behaviour and occupation of a country. For example: in the USA the rate of dead people is significantly higher but even after that their economic activities have not totally stopped. General people have to understand the core value of the economy. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Which should be preferred more, Lives or Living?&rdquo; This has been an enormous question for decades. Lives and living are entirely connected to each other. So we have to run both live and living at the same time. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The consumers are the biggest strength of economics. Because of the pandemic, the urban people have reduced their buying limitation but have not totally stopped it. Similarly, even though the income rate of rural people has reduced by a lot, still they are active and contributing from their perspectives. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garment sector plays a vital role in the world economy. Researchers predicted that there would be a disaster in this sector because of covid. Although this sector has recovered from the primary collision, the revenue rate from this sector has reduced drastically. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unstable growth of remittance has played a vital role in this covid economy policy. In many countries, this growth rate has gone up. Which seems like a magnificent prospect. This growth has definitely helped those countries to recover from this pandemic. But thinking about the long run, it is an alarming sign. Because of covid, a lot of expatriate people have come back to their native country with all their savings. Also, many have sent extra money for their family to survive in this pandemic. Therefore, we are experiencing this growth. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as a lot of expatriate people have come back and a lot of them have lost their jobs abroad, it seems like it is going to create a major hole in the future remittance growth. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can assume that the entire world is going to fall into a deep economic crisis because of covid. Many international organizations have predicted that the Gross Domestic Production (GDP) will be reduced significantly in most of the countries. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unemployment has already been a curse in the world. Many research and statistics anticipate that a large number of youths are going to lose their jobs in this pandemic. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The government of every country is trying their heart and soul to prevent these damages. They are providing mass people with relief and social packages. Also, they are trying to reduce the social gap among people created by this pandemic. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it is a responsibility for all of us to put our best effort and help the government get rid of this pandemic. The economy is sick now. And we all need to play our parts to cure it. </span></p></body></html>
