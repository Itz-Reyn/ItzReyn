    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Life is a sum of some memories and events. It is like an energy source. We can feel it, we are</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;living through it, but we can&rsquo;t objectify it. We think we are controlling it, while we are like sands</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;in a desert in front of it. Scientifically, the definition of life is operational. They allow us to</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;separate living things from non- living things. But they don&rsquo;t actually pin down what life is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Life is cruel and humble at the same time. Life is bound to no one. We can&rsquo;t control it. The best</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;we can do is change the perspective of seeing it. Not all the events of life are satisfactory.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Failure is one of the biggest parts of our life. It is upon us to choose the events we will act on.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;From the day of our birth, we start to chase it. We have no clue how far we will go. But we all</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;take part in this non predictive run. We all see dreams, imagine ourselves as the king of our own</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;kingdom. But there is a lot of difference between dreaming for success and capitalizing on them </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">in reality. Not everybody has the caliber to do that. Those who can find the meaning of it and </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">cope with it are the ones who write the success stories.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Life is a riddle. There is no shortcut to solve this. No one can copy others&#39; paths to gain</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;prosperity. Everyone gets different surroundings, environment, people and other living stuff.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Everyone needs to solve this puzzle of life in their own way. The best one can do is to take</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;motivation from their motive figure and use that in their own way. Self-motivation, hard work</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;and focus are the three major things on the path of life. It is simple when one gives his best,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;irrespective of his surroundings. One word of life that demands is to focus on yourself. Another</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;such element is hope. Hope is what gives us a way to survive. Survival and hope are important</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;aspects for anyone and everyone as far as living is considered.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c8">&nbsp;
    
    ABOUT ME:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I thought writing about myself would be a simple thing to do. But I was wrong about it. Brainstorming my ideas is not an easy task. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know how far I will go. How much success I am going to get. How many dream &nbsp;sequences of mine I can implement on my real life. But all I want is a simple thing, I will conduct &nbsp;myself in every opportunity and show my best form in every single aspect.

I like to explore new staff all the time. I &nbsp;don&rsquo;t want to bind myself to a particular thing. Among all the activities, some of these are really &nbsp;cabalistic for me.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9 c8">&nbsp;<br>RESEARCH INTERN AT RED GREEN RESEARCH INSTITUTE:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Research in the STEM field is always so fascinating and challenging. As a high school student, &nbsp; it was a great opportunity to pursue a research experience beyond theoretical knowledge. I &nbsp;attended a workshop on Computational Chemistry and Drug Molecule. It was a significant experience working with my professor alongside some amazing people. I have learnt a lot about real-life problem solving. Also, working on a group project and interacting with different cohorts was a fantastic experience.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8 c9">&nbsp;<br>INTERNSHIP AT ROBOMENT R&amp;D LAB:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;From my very childhood, robotics and automation were the most fascinating things for me. As a &nbsp;fan of iron man(just kidding),pursuing a career in robotics is my aim in life. I always tried to &nbsp;extend my limit in this aspect. And this internship is like the perfect start for me in this journey. </span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9 c8">&nbsp;<br>SILVER AWARD PARTICIPANT IN DUKE EDINBURGH AWARD CENTER:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Duke Edinburgh is a challenging program for youths. Here I have grown my efficiency and &nbsp; learnt different real life skills. Going through a particular process for a certain period of time &nbsp;has taught me how to be more patient and focus on gaining life&#39;s goals. </span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9 c8">&lsquo;
        <br><br>
        PROJECT HASHIMUKH&rsquo; WITH YOUTH MOVEMENT ORGANIZATION:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Working with a non-profit organization was an eminent experience for me. I have learnt a lot while interacting with different kinds of people. Also, working for the betterment of the society is a pleasant thing to do. I will always remember those merry faces I have seen after helping each of those needy people.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;<br><br><br>There are more competitions, and people are getting self-obsessed day by day. To survive and make a position in this fast-forward world, everyone is serving themselves from different angles. Everyone has got different purposes in their life. Some people find that early in their life, others find it later on, still others never do. Satisfaction is the thing we all search for in our whole life. But most of us don&rsquo;t find that in our life.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Actually, it is more of a self realization which we never do. The true taste of life we will find when we realize while living that we wake up in the morning and tell ourselves as we look into the mirror , that life is the best thing that ever happened to us. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
