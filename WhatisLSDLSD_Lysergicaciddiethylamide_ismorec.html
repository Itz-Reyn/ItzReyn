                    <a href="#">New Data Analysis
                    </a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* What is LSD: LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide) is more commonly known as acid. Which is known as a: hallucinogenic drug. LSD disrupts the function of the human body, the body, the brain, the serotonin receptor, and its effects. LSD is also known as LSD-25, Acid, Delysid</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* &zwnj; Discovery: O: History: LSD was first created on November 18-1937. It was made by the Swiss chemist Albert Hoffmann at the Sandoz Laboratory in Switzerland. This LSD has been created through a huge research program. The main goal of the research program was to create important medicines for medical care from mustard and alkaloid varieties. The result is LSD.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Until now, the research team knows nothing about the effects of LSD. Learn about the effects of LSD April 19 - 1943, five years after the discovery of LSD. When the discoverer Hoffman unknowingly took LSD. Later he came to know that his LSD intake was 250 micrograms:!!!!!!!!! Where normal 20 micrograms have the proper effect, Hoffman mistakenly took 250 micrograms !!!.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where normal 20 micrograms have the appropriate effect, Hoffman accidentally took 250 micrograms !!!. The inventor Hoffman himself gave the &quot;first&quot; opinion on the experience of receiving LSD. Later, in 1947, Sandoze Laboratory introduced LSD as a medicine. He was marketed as LSD by psychopathic panacea. And they praised LSD as an invention for the treatment of all mental health problems (from schizophrenia to criminal behavior, sexual misconduct and alcoholism).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the early 1950s, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) coded a research program called MK Ultra. The main purpose of which was to do research on LSD. As a result, the CIA bought LSD supplies worldwide for 240,000$.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this LSD CIA promotes it in American hospitals, clinics, prisons and research centers through their main agency. In addition, the test included providing LSDs to CIA personnel, military personnel, doctors, other government agents, the mentally ill, and the general public &zwnj; to study their unintentional responses to common issues. The US Congressional Rockefeller Commission published a report on the project in 1975.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">October 24, 1984: Occupancy of LSD is declared illegal in the United States. However, in Switzerland, the use of legally approved and regulated psychological LSD continued until 1993. However, in November 2020, the United States became the first country to legally legalize LSD. However, a vote was held to validate this.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Chemical Discussion: LSD is: Eargolin and Alkaloid. Whose molecular signal is C20H25N3O. And its molecular mass is 323.4g / mol. And the melting point is 60 &deg; -75 &deg; C. LSD is a tasteless, odorless substance. It is soluble in water and, in addition to water, it dissolves in other inert organic solvents. It dissolves in acid solution.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Synthesis: The process of making LSD is complex which only a valid and experienced chemist can make. For the convenience of everyone, no model of chemical reaction is shown here. It is written according to where it is made from so that everyone can understand from a relative point of view. There are many processes for making LSD, one of which is using lysergic acid in the past. Lysergic acid is often used in those secret laboratories as Ergometrine or Ergometrine Tartrate to make LSD.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Ergotamine is produced naturally from the Ergot fungus (Calviceps Purpurea) which is a common mustard parasite. Other reagents include N, N-Carbonyldi-imidazole, Diethylamine&zwnj; or Hydrazine. The next step is to immerse the small paper (Blotters) or LSDs in the LSD in the alcoholic solution of Tartrate salt. This is how a micro dot or micro strip is made.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Taking: Procedure: We usually calculate the amount of any medicine or medicine in milligrams (mg). That means we measure LSD ten times smaller than the unit of measurement of ordinary medicine !!. But LSD is a drug that has a very serious effect, so it is made or calculated in micrograms. 1g = 100000 ug (micrograms) !!. These LSD dots are ten times smaller than a grain of sand. Each dot is (40-500) ug (microgram) respectively.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Think how insignificant things are playing the biggest role &zwnj; !!!!!!! For the loss of mental balance ... 40ug tao: much more: amount !!!. In general: lsd is taken: 25ug micro dots .. These LSD micro dots are used orally. Again many times LSD is taken with liquid shaped veins. Market: Different names: Common Blotter, Dots, Tabs, Ticket, Trip, etc.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Effects: We will divide the damage of LSD into three parts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1. Physical</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">2. Mentally</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">3. Sensory</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1. Physical:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Expansion of the pupil of the eye</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Loss of appetite</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Excessive sweating</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Insomnia</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The above reactions are common reactions that occur in all cases. In addition, LSD has a higher degree of effect, depending on the individual. According to the report, there may be some effect on it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Increase in body temperature</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Increases the amount of glucose in the blood</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Increased heartbeat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Excessive erection of body hair. (Excluding normal reasons)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Jaws of the mouth become stiff and loose</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Hyperreflexia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There may be other physical problems that are not specific.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">2. Mental: The most common and immediate effects of LSD are hallucinations and hallucinations. That is, a person with LSD will see, hear, and feel something that does not really exist. This effect depends on the full dose. The higher the dose, the greater the hallucinations and the longer the effects. The effects of LSD&zwnj; usually occur within 20 to 30 minutes of ingestion. If liquid LSD is taken intravenously, the effect is earlier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The effects of this LSD last up to about 20 hours, depending on the dose. Even a few days after taking the user&#39;s LSD, even up to a few weeks, some experience is experienced. Which can&#39;t be said right will be good or bad. Because LSD is not only bad, LSD often works well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such as giving intense joy to people, keeping the mind cheerful, keeping the mind fresh or increasing spiritual strength. Increased ability to concentrate. All this work increases LSD if there is a good strip: Again the user has to face a bad experience which is often deadly dangerous. Here are the symptoms</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bad: Emotions: Emotions</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Fear-anxiety without any reason can lead to anxiety, paranoia, distrust, despair, and even suicide.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Sensory: LSD controls the serotonin part of our brain and creates imaginary scenes. In other words, you will feel that at that time there will be no real existence here !! The higher the dose, the higher the level of hallucinations. The recipient then begins to think of himself in various ways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to some reports, the recipients said they felt as if they were rising into the sky, floating in a variety of flower gardens, everything in front of them was going inside, the sound of house walls was changing. Many even say that they have discovered themselves in the past. That is, he thinks that is why he has gone into the past. In other words, in simple words, everything will change for you.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Pharmacology / How to: Effect: LSD in the brain: As mentioned earlier, LSD interacts with the receptors of the brain&#39;s serotonin hormone to create hallucinations in our brain. Now let&#39;s say a little bit of this serotonin?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Serotonin is a type of hormone that is directly related to our mood, emotion, and brain, and nerve cells. In other words, serotonin is responsible for making us feel good, to be happy, to be happy, to make us feel happy, to make us feel better, to make us feel good, to make us feel good, to make us feel good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Decreased levels of serotonin can lead to emotional disorders, depression, anxiety, and even suicidal ideation !!! So it is very important to control the level of serotonin. Let&#39;s go on the topic now. Basically, LSD forms a complex bond with the serotonin receptor (5-HT2A, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C). 5-HT2A plays a major role for the hallucination of a major receptor LSD. However, it is not possible to know exactly how LSD produces this hallucination effect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it is thought that LSD increases glutamate secretion in the cerebral cortex and activates the IV and V layers of the brain. Many studies have shown that LSD and many other halo genic drugs have been shown to play a role in activating DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated neuronal phospho protein) in the brain. Increases the activation of complex inserts such as LSD-D2 receptor proto-mara and D2-5 HT2A.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Which basically plays an important role in emotional change. This is mainly due to the effects of LSD.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* Usage: LSD was originally created for psychiatric treatment. And in the beginning, this medicine was applied to patients suffering from various mental disorders. They got much better results. Which was temporary. The effects of this LSD fell on them badly. Currently, it is banned except in some countries in the world.</span></p><div><h2 class="c4" id="h.6jb7z6b8pw4k"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></div></body></html>
