                    <h4>Black holes are the heaviest objects in the universe.And the least known object.with the death of a giant star, a black hole forms.
                        Then the gravitational force at the center of the star pulls the star to its center. <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Then due to the extra contraction the pressure in the star goes out and all the energy goes to the universe through the super nova explosion.
                        But if the mass of a star is much greater from the mass of Raman then they can gain 2 forms through the supernova. <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1 Neutron stars <br>
                        2 Black holes <br>
                        <br>
                        What is a black hole? <br>
                        <br>
                        A black hole is an object that can break up space-time. Its gravitational force is so great that it cannot emit any object, not even electromagnetic waves (light)
                        The area in which no object can actually move out is called "event horizon", and the bright light we see in the picture is called "event horizon".
                        There is one more thing out there, which is full of dust.,<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The center of a black hole is called "singularity". It is estimated that its mass and density are infinite.
                        Anything that passes by a black hole is attracted to its center due to its extra gravity and falls into the black hole. The more objects enter it, the more its mass increases.
                        Black holes change the path of light. We know that when light passes through it, it never comes back, so it looks black. <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But when light goes to a certain angle and passes through a certain place, it does not fall into the black hole and returns at a much larger angle. This place is near the edge of the "event horizon" and because of this it looks brighter. Due to which M7K was identified in 2019.
                        We see many ring-like objects next to black holes in many images computer simulations. These are "attraction disks". But why are they everywhere? This is because of the space-time curvature. The amount of space-time curvature caused by the massive mass of a black hole changes the direction of light abnormally. Due to which the direction of light changes. Due to this change we see 1 action disk at 3 o'clock
                        Black holes evaporate like other stars. This process is called "Hawking radiation" <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The idea is that when a particle and an anti-particle come close to the event horizon of a black hole, one particle falls into the black hole and the other escapes, causing a loss of energy. But this process is so slow that it takes 1000000000000000000 years to decay 0.001%. And black holes eat more than they consume.
                        Black holes can be divided into two parts, <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1- stellar black hole- mass 40-60 times from the sun <br>
                        <br>
                        2-super massive black hole- a few billion times more than the sun <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The super massive black hole near us is the Segeterius A star. Which is located on our Milky Way
                        And the Stellar black hole we have is HR7819. Which is 3000 light years away.
