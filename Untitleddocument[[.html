This independence has come by paying the cost of a sea of blood. Bangladesh has a brief history of sacrifice,struggle and war. In the past the country was under several colonies. The country was under British colony till 1947. After getting apart from British colony and causing the birth of two different countries India and Pakistan, Bangladesh was gone under the Pakistan colony. Which was another controversial participation.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp; Pakistan had two parts. East and West Pakistan. The present Bangladesh was then East Pakistan and the current Pakistan was West Pakistan. There was a difference of 1200 square mile between two Pakistan. Even after gaining the tag of a new forming country, Pakistan, this land was not free. The discrimination between two Pakistan was explicit. In every aspect of the country, East Pakistan was on the lower side. Education, Health, Military, Politics they discriminated in every sector. The most horrific example of this inequality was choosing the national language of the country. Even though almost 56% of the total population was Bengali and Bangla was their primary language, The Pakistan government had chosen Urdu as their national language. The Bengalis didn&rsquo;t tolerate this discriminations. They fought back, they protested against every unequal decision of the government. But this paired country was never meant to reside. The Bengali people realised that they are not going to get their rights unless they get separation from Pakistan and form their own country. So they headed toward gaining independence from Pakistan.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;As a result, the most drastic event of Bangladesh&rsquo;s history happened, a liberation war of 9 months. The brutal force of the Pakistan army was launched against the unarmed Bengalis on the midnight of 26 March,1971. They killed almost 10 thousand people on that night, took control of every important structure of the country and imprisoned the bright faces of the country. This genocide event of that night is known as &ldquo;Operation Searchlight&rdquo;. The Bengalis fought back. People of all ages joined the war. They sacrificed their lives for the sake of their motherland. More than 3 million people had died in this war. &nbsp;Many countries and organizations of the world also stood with Bangladesh. With the support of the majority of the countries of the world and an exterminator war, Bangladesh had gained its victory against the Pakistan army on December 16,1971. No other country in the world had got their independence in such a quick time. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c14">THE FATHER OF THE NATION BANGABANDHU SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Every nation has a great leader who enlightened the path of freedom for the nation&rsquo;s people. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was a true saviour for Bangladesh. He was the pioneer of the most successful political party of Bangladesh, Awami League. From his student life, he devoted himself to the people of Bangladesh. He fought for people&#39;s rights against Pakistani government. That&rsquo;s why he was always the major victim and the eye pain of Pakistani government. As a result, he had spent almost half of the Pakistan colony period in jail. During Operation Searchlight, he got arrested in the first place. But before that he had declared the independence of Bangladesh and instructed mass people to fight against Pakistani Army. The people of all ages had responded to his words and fought till gaining total freedom. After independence, he came back to the country and took the major responsibility of rebuilding this country. He was the first president of Bangladesh. In his whole life, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had one goal, to fight for the rights of Bengali. That&rsquo;s why even after a long time of his death, He is in the middle of every Bengalis heart.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Interesting facts about Bangladesh:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">&#10730;</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;Bangladesh has the largest Mangrove forest, Sundarban.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c17">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Located in the southwestern part of Bangladesh, Sundarban is the largest halophytic mangrove &nbsp; forest in the world.

General people protested against the unjustified decision of denying Bangla as the national language of then Pakistan government. People of all ages and occupations had joined that movement. Even many of them had lost their lives. A language monument (known as Shaheed Minar) has been created to remember those national heroes who laid down their lives on that day. UNESCO had declared 21st February as International Mother Language Day as a remembrance of this day in November,1999.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">&#10730;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bangladesh has the longest female lead government.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Bangladesh is the only country in the world where the leader of the government is a female for more than two decades.
